## Bagels

Here's a seemingly simple challenge. We're giving you a class called bagel, exactly as it appears below. All it really does is return an int, specifically 3.

        sealed class Bagel 
        {
            public int Value { get; private set; } = 3;
        }

The catch? For the solution, we're testing that the result is equal to 4. But as a little hint, the solution to this Kata is (almost) exactly the same as the example test cases.
