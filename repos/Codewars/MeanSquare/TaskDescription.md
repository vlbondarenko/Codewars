## Mean Square Error

Complete the function that:

* accepts two arrays of equal length
* compares the value each member in one array to the corresponding member in the other
* squares the absolute value difference between those two values
* and returns the average of those squared absolute value difference between each member pair.

    solution([1,2,3], [4,5,6]) // should === 9 ((9 + 9 + 9) / 3)
    solution([10, 20, 10, 2], [10, 25, 5, -2]) // should === 16.5 ((0 + 25 + 25 + 16) / 4)
    solution([-1,0], [0,-1]) // should === 1 ((1 + 1) / 2)
